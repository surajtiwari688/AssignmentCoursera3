			Rajam Dal
		</div>
		<p>
			Rajma dal is a red kidney bean curry that is a popular dish in northern India, though it's enjoyed throughout the country. It is a tasty vegetarian recipe that cooks the beans in a spicy masala paste featuring ginger, garlic, chilies, and tomatoes.


If you're looking for a satisfying meal that comes together in less than half an hour, this is an excellent choice. The rustic dish is cooked in a single pan and is very easy to make. To complete the meal, it's traditional to serve rajma dal with plain boiled rice, Kachumbar salad, and a pickle.
